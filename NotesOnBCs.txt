Looks like most time-dependent BCs are in bcin_9ha_A.f, from bc_wmo10_9ha.dat
(fort.20); this is I think pretty much the same as previous model, should be
fairly simple to translate over.

But, in tempin_9hb_A.f, there's:
C  Read in bottom boundary conditions for CO2; array CO2BCIN(18,101,360) is in
COMMON
C    daily values for 1950-2050 (101 years)
c 
       OPEN (79, FILE = 'co2bc_day.xdr', 

So this I'm not sure about.  "Bottom" BCs, but are time dependent.
----> Have to pay attention to this, since I want to control the CO2 values

Similar with H2O
