Working on porting.

May 2017
I've been fixing various things, mainly old-style commands like "type" instead
of "print".

Currently (25 May) on getmomx_9gg.f
"1PSIC" is apparently un-declared and I can't find it defined anywhere.  Stuck
on that right now.
I think the "1" is the problem.  "PSIC" is definded and used.  The 1 looks
like a typo, though it appears in two places (symmetric).  Could be an
idiosyncracy of the style rather than a typo, which is not recognized now.
Pretty sure that the 1 should be removed and it will be fine.


Leaving that (no change as of 27 May)
Moved on, now at twodlib_9gl_A.f -- several syntax items to change.


Nov 2017
Didn't really keep this up to date...
Basically, just a bunch more syntax issues.

Now changing things for my purposes.  I've tried to mark all changes from here
with "BThomas MonthYear".  Mainly so far just making changes to output.
